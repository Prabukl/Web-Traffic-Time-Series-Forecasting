## **Overview**

Time series forecasting is a powerful analytical method used to predict future values based on previously observed data. It leverages trends, cyclical patterns, and seasonality to make predictions. Common applications include forecasting stock prices, economic indicators like GDP, and other sequential financial or economic data.

### **How to Analyze Time Series Data**

Statistical techniques are essential for analyzing time series data. These techniques can be used in two primary ways:

1. **Inference Generation**: To assess how one or more variables impact another variable of interest over time.
2. **Trend Forecasting**: To predict future trends based on historical data.

### **Example Use Case**

Time series analysis can be applied to a variety of data types, such as historical stock prices, company earnings, or GDP figures. By analyzing these sequences of data, one can make informed predictions about future values.

## **Datasets Overview**

### **1. train_.csv**
- **Description**: Contains traffic data. Each row represents a specific article, and each column corresponds to a particular date. The dataset includes some missing data.
- **Page Name Format**: The page names follow this format: `'name_project_access_agent'`. For example, `'AKB48_zh.wikipedia.org_all-access_spider'` where:
  - `name`: Article name
  - `project`: Wikipedia project (e.g., `en.wikipedia.org`)
  - `access`: Type of access (e.g., `desktop`)
  - `agent`: Type of agent (e.g., `spider`)

### **2. key_.csv**
- **Description**: Provides the mapping between page names and the shortened Id column used for prediction. This is crucial for linking traffic data to the corresponding pages.
